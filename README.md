# Voedselcode

Started coding: dec, 2018.

After 1 month of learning at home I participated at a Hackaton, beginning january 2019, at CodeGorilla Breda. 

This was the first step before I could join the Bootcamp of 3 months afterwards. 

We were divided in teams of 3 / 4 and were assigned to create a website with all the skills we had learned for the passed month. 

The website had to solve a problem in current society. 

So we decided to create a Dutch website about foodwaste. 

It was real fun to do, and in the end, after about 20 hours,  we won the FIRST price :)!

And here started the Bootcamp of 3 months for me.
